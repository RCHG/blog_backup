### Definition

Mie Scattering is the solution of the scattering problem described with the Maxwell Equations, for a sphere. Initially the solution of Mie (or Lorenz-Mie) was designed for homogeneous spheres, however there are extensions for multilayered spheres and with important limitations for other geometrical objects.

### How is formulated?

The mathematical solution of the scattering problem is finally written in terms of the **Phase Matrix** and intermediate series based on Bessel functions and Legendre Polynomia of $cos(\theta)$ , where $$\theta$$ is the scattering angle.

The calculation is relatively efficient but depends on the **size parameter**, $$x=2\pi r/\lambda$$. When this parameter increases the number of terms of the series necessaries to calculate the relevant amounts also grows.
