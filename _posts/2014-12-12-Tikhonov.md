> Very short comment on Tikhonov regularization

## Tikhonov regularization method

This method is widely used to resolve discrete ill-posed inverse linear problems
(also non-linear). The problem it is usually establish as,

$$
y=F(x)
$$

where F(x) is a linear operator, therefore we may write,

$$
y=Kx
$$

The solution of the inverse discrete problem its usually described with the singular value decomposition.
Then it is defined the pseudoinverse of K as,
$$
K^{\dagger}=(K^{T}K)^{-1}K^{T}=V\Sigma^{\dagger}U^{T}
$$

The Tikhonov regularization propose another definition of the pseudoinverse which includes a regularization matrix $$L$$
and a regularization parameter $$\alpha$$,

$$
K^{\dagger}=(K^{T}K+\alpha L^{T}L)^{-1}K^{T}=\bar{V}\Sigma^{\dagger}_{\alpha}\bar{U}^{T}
$$

the last equation is used the generalized singular value decomposition.
