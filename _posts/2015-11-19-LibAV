### Library

The library is named **libav-tools** so it is very install to install in linux/Unix with the package manager of your distribution.

### How to use

If you have an specific animation for example: my_animation.mp4 and you would like to extract few frames from it:

{% highlight bash %}
> avconv -i my_animation.mp4 -r 4 -ss 00:00:00 -t 00:00:10 -f image2 %04d.png
{% endhighlight %}

This command will create 4 images per second of the movie between the second 00:00:00 and 00:00:10 and will create .png files 
named as 0001.png, 0002.png etc...
