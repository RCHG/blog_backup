## Introduction

This post is a short tutorial on OpenMPI. The main goal is be familiar with the
general concepts and terminology used on MPI parallel programming. The code shown
is in Fortran 90.

We have to realize that there are three important elements on parallel programing
in cluster systems: hardware, software and the topology of the network. 

## Definitions

#### FLOPS

It is the number of floating point operations per second. It is used to describe
the computation capability. 

#### Flynn's Taxonomy

- SISD: single instruction single data (serial computer)
- SIMD: single instruction multiple data (vector computer)
- MISD: multiple instruction single data (uncommon)
- MIMD: multiple instruction multiple data (parallel computer).

We will use the terminology SPMD to mean single program multiple data. The idea is a
commom code runned on several computers. But each node process different data (the
data of each node should be distribuited by the single code).

#### Performance related concepts

- Serial time: time to run the code in 1 machine (serial code): ts
- Parallel time: time to process the same code with p processors: tp
- Speedup factor: S(p)=ts/tp
- Work cost: W(p)=p*tp
- Efficiency: E(p)=ts/(p*tp)=W(1)/W(p)
- Serial fraction: f, is the fraction of the code that is allways serial (it is allways runned
by only 1 processor).
- Overhead: (Wp-W1)/W1
- Computation time: fraction of time running the code (tc)
- Comunication time: fraction of the time performing transmission or comunication between nodes and memory (tt)

Note: it is important maximize tc/tt

#### Amdahl's law

tp=f*ts+(1-f)*ts/p
S(p)=p/(f(p-1)+1)

####Guftafson's law

ts=f*tp+(1-f)*p*tp
S(p)=f+(1-f)*p
