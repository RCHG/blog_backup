> One thing I have learned in a long life: that all our science, measured against reality, is primitive and childlike -- and yet it is the most precious thing we have. â€• **Albert Einstein**

## Overview

My research background cover several fields and a broad set of methodologies both theoretical and experimental, with a strong focus on computational tools. My initial formation is Physics with an specialization on Theoretical Physics. This side was developed during my M.Sc. in Condensed Matter which was related with Statistical Physics in a theoretical field of Theory of Liquids. However my interest has been moved to the field of Atmospheric Sciences and Remote Sensing. Therefore the main scope of my PhD was related with Micro-physics of rainfall and remote sensing of precipitation, which also involves Applied Statistics. Actually I am working at the field of Remote Sensing of Trace Gases, this improves my knowledge on radiative transfer theory, inverse problem,satellite product, and spectroscopy.


## Research Assistant


The central goal of the project I am working is related with a consolidation of the ESA satellite Sentinel-5 requirements. This means a detailed study of the different error sources like instrumental, spectroscopy, forward models errors derived of an effective description of the atmosphere aerosols and cirrus. To be able to conduct this research I use state of the art retrieval algorithms (inverse problem and radiative transfer solver) with trial ensembles of geophysical scenarios. Additional aspects of the research are: evaluate the cloud cover with Meteosat datasets, integrate satellite products of MODIS and CALIPSO with datasets obtained from offline chemical transport model.


## PhD. Dissertation

**Important Note:**  would recommend check the following link to download a PDF file with the Dissertation. However, please note that this version and the version upload to the arXiv repository are not equal the official filled version at my university. More specifically: I finished my PhD Dissertation on November 2011, however it was not filled until June-2012, therefore I included additional research that I did by myself on the filled version. But also after the filling of my PhD still I work more on the topic and I have added several improvements (and they were included on the version uploaded to arXiv and on the first pdf linked above).

### Abstract:

The main challenges of measuring precipitation are related to the spatio-temporal variability of the drop-size distribution, to the uncertainties that condition the modeling of that distribution, and to the instrumental errors present in the in situ estimations. This PhD dissertation proposes advances in all these questions. The relevance of the spatial variability of the drop-size distribution for remote sensing measurements and hydro-meteorology field studies is asserted by analyzing the measurement of a set of disdrometers deployed on a network of 5 squared kilometers. This study comprises the spatial variability of integral rainfall parameters, the ZR relationships, and the variations within the one moment scaling method. The modeling of the drop-size distribution is analyzed by applying the MaxEnt method and comparing it with the methods of moments and the maximum likelihood. The instrumental errors are analyzed with a compressive comparison of sampling and binning uncertainties that affect actual devices. These analysis are further extended in several appendices where an error analysis is developed and new studies are proposed. The relevance of the pre-processing of disdrometric measurements is also assessed. The data-sets evaluated comprise experimental measurements of the GPM (NASA-JAXA) ground validation satellite mission and synthetic distributions generated computationally.


## M.Sc. Dissertation

### Abstract:

Two different theories are used to understand the liquid-vapor interfaces: the Van der Waals theory and the capillary waves theory. But comparing both come up a problem of interpretation of the interface density profiles obtained, for example, with the Density Functional Theory (DFT). As a consequence emerge the question of how the surface fluctuations are included on traditional density profiles (usually named equilibrium density profiles). Last years, new insights on the role of capillary waves were possible by analyzing X-ray reflectivity experiments and performing computer simulations of liquids with low melting temperature. In particular, the density profile exhibits a layering structure which is considered a key property to elucidate a new interpretation of those profiles as intrinsic density profiles. This dissertation aims to investigate these questions within the DFT using simple fluids with a pairwise interactions that reproduce important phase-diagram properties of liquid metals. Two generics questions were explored: the relevance of Fisher-Widom line and the role of capillary waves on the nature of interface obtained with approximations WDA and FMT. It hypothesized the existence of a density profile with strong layering properties whose structure is reduced by capillary waves. Then the effect of surface fluctuations is described by introducing an effective transversal size which imposes a limitation of the spectrum of surface fluctuations incorporated on the DFT. However, an explicit methodology to unfreeze the capillary waves over a postulated intrinsic profile exempt of surface fluctuations was proven still a challenge. As a consequence it suggested that other previous results describing the liquid surface using the equilibrium DFT may conduct to unphysical properties.

## Hydrometeorology

If `jekyll build` and `jekyll serve` throw errors you may have to run Jekyll with `bundled exec` instead.

> In some cases, running executables without bundle exec may work, if the executable happens to be installed in your system and does not pull in any gems that conflict with your bundle.
>
>However, this is unreliable and is the source of considerable pain. Even if it looks like it works, it may not work in the future or on another machine.
